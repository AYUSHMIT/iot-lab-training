    "## Getting started with LoRaWAN on IoT-LAB using RIOT\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to discover the basics of LoRaWAN communication using RIOT on IoT-LAB and TheThingsNetwork (TTN) as LoRaWAN network provider. This Notebook is divided in several steps:\n",
    "1. The first step requires you to configure a LoRaWAN application with one device on the TTN backend\n",
    "2. Then you will submit an experiment with one ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1 node (known as st-lrwan1) on the Saclay site\n",
    "3. Once the experiment is running, you will build and flash a RIOT application that provides a shell to control the LoRaWAN stack. On the board, you will configure the identifiers and keys required for Over-The-Air Activation (OTAA).\n",
    "4. In the last step of this tutorial, you will exchange messages between the board and TTN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LoRaWAN overview\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRaWAN is a set of protocols built on top of the LoRa radio technology. It allows end devices to send messages on long distances and with potentially a very low power consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LoRa technology uses a Chirp Spreading Spectrum frequency modulation within public radio frequency bands (ISM). The access to the physical layer is regulated and depends on the region of use. On IoT-LAB, the EU868 ISM band is used by the boards, because they are all located in Europe and the boards can only transmit on this band.\n",
    "\n",

    "    <figcaption><em>The LoRaWAN stack</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The LoRaWAN specifications define 3 classes of end-devices: A, B, C. Each of which has specific access to the physical layer. For more details, please refer to the LoRa specifications provided by the LoRa Alliance [here](https://www.lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a global overview of a LoRaWAN network:\n",

    "    <figcaption><em>The LoRaWAN infrastructure</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "End devices use LoRa modulation to communicate with the gateways, which themselves use the regular Internet protocols to communicate with the LoRaWAN server, owned by a provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "A TTN gateway is installed in the IoT-LAB Saclay site and connected to the TTN backend server. Thus, this allows LoRa devices deployed in the Saclay site to communicate with the TTN backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure a TTN application\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the LoRa devices in IoT-LAB, you have to create an account and register an application with a device configured on TTN.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you donâ€™t already have a TTN account, create one from [here](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/register)\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/ttn-signup.png\" width=\"640\" align=\"center\"/><br/><br/>\n",
    "    <figcaption><em>TTN signup interface</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "After submitting the account creation form, check your emails and then activate the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add an application to your TTN account by following [the official documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/add.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Register a device in your TTN application by following [this documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/registration.html).\n",
    "   Keep the default Other-The-Air Activation (OTAA) procedure.The OTAA activation requires 3 informations:\n",
    "   - **Device EUI**: the device unique identifier is a 8 bytes array (16 hex char string)\n",
    "   - **Application EUI**: the application unique identifier is a 8 bytes array (16 hex char string)\n",
    "   - **Application Key**: the application key is a 16 bytes array (32 hex char string)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** In the following instructions of this tutorial, we consider that your application name is **_iotlab-lorawan_** and your node id is **_iotlab-node_**. Replace these occurences with the information you configured in your TTN account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Book and configure one LoRa device\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's book one the LoRa device available in the IoT-LAB testbed. The boards are [ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html):\n",
