    "If you are reading this introduction it's because JupyterLab is running in the IoT-LAB virtual machine. JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, code editors and terminals. You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are documents that combine live runnable code with narrative text (Markdown), equations (LaTeX), images, interactive visualizations and other rich output. It is used by scientists and scholars to create and share their research, especially in the data science community.\n",

    "The notebook consists of a sequence of cells. A cell is a multiline text input field, and its contents can be executed by using Shift-Enter, or by clicking either the “Play” button.\n",

    "\n",
    "A code cell allows you to edit and write new code, with full syntax highlighting and tab completion.\n",

    "In general, Jupyter notebooks contain Python code. Once selected the cell should be executed with `Shift+Enter` shortcut. The results that are returned from this computation are then displayed in the notebook as the cell’s output.\n",
