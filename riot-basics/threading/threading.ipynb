    "\n",
    "To monitor running threads, the application needs 1) to start a shell and 2) to extend the shell with commands for printing threads activity. In RIOT, this can be done by simply extending the provided template application as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the `Makefile` file, add the following:\n",
    "\n",

    "USEMODULE += shell_commands\n",
    "USEMODULE += ps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `shell_commands` module will automatically build shell commands provided by other modules in the application. The `ps` module provides a shell command to monitor the threads activity.\n",

    "\n",
    "In `main.c` file, in the `main` function, just run the shell as follows (under the comment `/* Start the shell here */`:\n",
