## Welcome to the IoT-LAB training resources

### Description

This repository contains training resources to easily start using the IoT-LAB
testbed.

The training resources are based on Jupyter notebooks that are run in a
preconfigured virtual machine.

### Setup

1. Close this repository:

  ```
  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/iot-lab/iot-lab-training

2. Setup the virtual machine using [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html):

  ```
  $ cd iot-lab-training
  $ vagrant up
  ```

3. Start JupyterLab

    1. Connect to the VM:
      ```
      $ vagrant ssh
      ```

    2. Launch JupyterLab:
      ```
      $ cd iot-lab-training
      $ ./bootstrap_jupyter.sh
      ```
      Keep this terminal opened during your training session.

    3. Shift+click on the link returned by the previous script: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=...`
  
    4. In JupyterLab, click on the start.ipynb file

*Shutdown:*
  - Stop JupyterLab by pressing Ctrl + C keyboard shortcut twice
  - Exit the VM with the `exit` command (or use the Ctrl + D keyboard shortcut)
